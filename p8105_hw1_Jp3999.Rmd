This is my solution to HW1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Problem 1

Create a data frame with the specific elements

```{r}
 prob1_df =
  tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10),
   samp_gt_0 = samp > 0,
  char_vec = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j"),
  factor_vec = factor(c("low","low","low", "mod", "mod", "mod", "mod", "high", "high", "high"))
)
```


 Take the mean of each variable in my data frame. 

```{r}
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp))
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))
mean(pull(prob1_df, char_vec))
mean(pull(prob1_df, factort_vec))
```

Take mean of numbers 

```{r}
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp))
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, char_vec))
as.numeric(pull(prob1_df, factort_vec))
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
